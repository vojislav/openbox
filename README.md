# openbox-stuff
All of my openbox .config files

Dependencies:

    -nitrogen -- for wallpapers
  
    -tint2 -- for tint2 panel
  
    -pnmixer -- tint2 volume mixer
  
    -thunar -- file manager
  
    -dmenu -- run applications
  
    -gnome-screensaver -- for the locker script
  
Optionally, you could also install chromium and spotify, so that all of my keybinds would work, but these, along with all other keybinds can be changed to your liking.

The two script I have are used to turn the the mouse pad on and off and the other one is a simple screen lock.
